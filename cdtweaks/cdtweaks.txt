The settings in this file allow for this mod to be installed in an unattended mode, e.g.
if you install Tweaks Anthology with the Big World Setup. A handful of components will
otherwise pause WeiDU and wait for input; defining these values ahead of time in this 
file will instead use the values defined here instead of waiting on user input in the
middle of installation.

// The following values are used for the Romance Cheats component. 
// Set this value to 1 if you want to use the values defined here:
OUTER_SET romance_use_config_values = 0

// This variable will remove the racial requirement if set to 1
// e.g. a value of 1 will allow Viconia to romance gnomes, or Aerie half-orcs
OUTER_SET romance_racial_requirements = 0

// This variable will remove the gender-based requirements for romances if set to 1
// e.g. a value of 1 will allow Anomen to romance males or Jaheira to romance females
OUTER_SET romance_gender_requirements = 0

// This variable will allow multiple romances if set to 1
// e.g. a value of 1 will allow you to romance both Jaheira and Aerie
OUTER_SET romance_multiple = 0

// This variable will prevent anything from ending a romance prematurely if set to 1
// e.g. with a value of 1 you can be as mean in dialogues as you like and the romance will proceed
// This also requires the romance_multiple, above, to be set to 1
OUTER_SET romance_nothing_kills = 0

// This variable controls whether romances start for new ToB games if set to 1
// e.g. if set to 1, summoning Anomen via the Fate Spirit in a new game will behave as if you romanced him in SoA
OUTER_SET romance_starts_in_ToB = 0



// This next batch of variables will be used for the  Minimum Stats Cheat component.
// Set this value to 1 if you wish to use the values defined here:

// The following six stats will be used as the minimums by the component itself.
// All values must be between 6 and 15, or 0 if you don't want to change them.
